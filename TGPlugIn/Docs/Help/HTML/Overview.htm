      <P>Why get an expensive e-mail server with a lot of features you really 
      don't need? With EMail Interceptor, you get features you can really 
      use.</P>
      <P>The EMail Interceptor is a full featured Internet standards compliant, 
      electronic mail server. It is the central repository for all electronic 
      mail communication to and from your organization and allows your computer 
      to communicate with other mail servers on the Internet. It acts as the 
      post office for the Internet e-mail clients on other computers on your 
      network. E-mail clients can communicate with the server to send and 
      receive e-mail locally or to the world via the Internet.</P>

      align=left v:shapes="_x0000_s1029"><B>Administration</B> - The EMail 
      Interceptor <I>Cockpit</I> Window makes e-mail management so easy that 
      even a novice can perform account maintenance and other common 
      administrative tasks. (Cb)</P><B>
      <P>Scalability</B> - True scalability allows the mail server to fit into 
      any size organization, from a handful of employees, to handling thousands 
      of employees and customers. With the unlimited user option, the price per 
      user actually decreases as your business grows. ODBC database support 
      allows for fast import of account and domain information and mailing list 
      addresses, eliminating traditional administrative burden. (Cb)</P>
      <P><B>Protocols</B> - EMail Interceptor supports the SMTP (Simple Mail 
      Transfer Protocol) and POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3). These are the 
      standard Electronic mail transfer protocols used on the Internet for 
      exchanging mail. SMTP is used for client-to-server and server-to-server 
      mail delivery and POP3 allows e-mail clients to receive mail (Cb). The 
      IMAP protocol provides a superior combination of stability, security, and 
      scalability. (V1) </P>
      <P><B>Speed</B> - As a native .Net multithreaded application, with 
      Multiple CPU Support, EMail Interceptor processes email faster than its 
      competitors (Cb). The Cached Memory Mode stores account information in 
      RAM, further increasing the server's speed and stability. (V1)</P><B>
      <P>Domains / IP Addresses</B> - You can use the EMail Interceptor to 
      deliver mail inside your organization with or without a connection to the 
      Internet. And the EMail Interceptor supports multiple virtual domains 
      across multiple IP addresses. (Cb)</P><B>
      <P>Mail-to-Pager &amp; Mail-to-Fax</B> - EMail Interceptor can route 
      messages to users' alphanumeric pagers. Additional add-ons let you send 
      e-mail to fax machines. (Vx)</P><B>

      <P>EMail Interceptor runs "out of the box", as well as provides an open 
      architecture for developers. The package includes source code for

      <P><B>Scheduled Backup</B> - Administrators can configure EMail 
      Interceptor to automatically backup critical system information, such as 
      user account data, server configurations, and license data, and will store 
      the backup file separate from the mail server. Should anything happen to 
      EMail Interceptor or the computer it is running on, restoration is made 
      easier with the backup file safely stored elsewhere. It is also possible 
      to run a manual backup at any time. (V1) </P>
      <P><B>Watchdog </B>- The watchdog on EMail Interceptor ensures that SMTP, 
      POP3, and IMAP services are always running. If, for any reason, any of the 
      services stop, the watchdog feature will restart the service 
      automatically. Administrators can set the time interval at which the 
      watchdog should start downed services. By automatically monitoring these 
      delivery protocols, EMail Interceptor is better equipped run smoothly and 
      deliver email. (V1) </P>
      <P><B>Disk Space Monitor </B>- The Disk Space monitor will track the 
      available hard disk space on the server computer. When the free space 
      reaches a user specified level, the Disk Space Monitor will trigger EMail 
      Interceptor to send notification to the server administrator. By actively 
      tracking the disk space, EMail Interceptor protects against failure caused 
      by a lack of memory. (V1) </P>
      <P><B>Extensive Logging </B>- 4 levels of server information logging. 
      Separate logs can be produced for each individual service in EMail 
      Interceptor (including POP3, SMTP, IMAP, and Control and HTTP services). 
      As well, EMail Interceptor can produce logs showing activity by users, 
      including the size and number of messages sent and received by each 
      account. (Cb, V1)</P>
      <P><B>ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity) Support</B> - EMail Interceptor 
      supports the Windows NT/2000/XP user account database, its own database, 
      or can connect to any ODBC compliant database (e.g. SQL®, MySQL, Access®, 
      Oracle® databases). This simplifies setup of user accounts, mailing lists, 
      etc., as existing lists can be imported into TekGuard: EMail Interceptor. 
      Support for ODBC connections also allows for centralized management of 
      user data. Instead of creating and maintaining user data in multiple 
      applications, administrators can manage and backup the data in one place, 
      accessing it fromEMail Interceptor with ease. This makes EMail Interceptor 
      integration with your existing customer billing, student enrollment, HR, 
      or other systems a snap. (Cb, V1)</P>
      <P><B>Source Code Support</B> - EMail Interceptor runs "out of the box",

      <P><B>Multiple Service Support</B> - EMail Interceptor will support

      <P><B>Multiple CPU Support</B> - EMail Interceptor will recognize and

      Multiple Domain Support, a single EMail Interceptor instance can handle

      administration burden inherent in running multiple email servers, all 
      email tasks can be made more efficient, and a company can apply consistent 
      routing and filtering rules across all of its accounts. This gives your
