TekGuard Anti-Spam SMTP Email Service

TekGuardEMail Interceptor is a Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) email service and software that fits between the outside world and your regular email server. EMail Interceptor acts as a front-end relay for SMTP email traffic before talking to your regular mail server. It filters incoming and outgoing emails before forwarding, filters incoming mail for spam, and outgoing messages based on possible access restrictions (ex: prohibits sending personal emails). EMail Interceptor provides a web interface for configuration, monitoring and for reviewing blocked messages prior to deletion.
